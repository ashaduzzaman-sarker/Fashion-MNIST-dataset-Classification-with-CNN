# Fashion MNIST dataset : Classification with CNN

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to build a neural network model to classify clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into 10 different categories. The objective is to achieve high accuracy in classifying the images.

## 2. Dataset Description
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of grayscale clothing items. Each image is 28x28 pixels and belongs to one of the following categories:
- 0: T-shirt/top
- 1: Trouser
- 2: Pullover
- 3: Dress
- 4: Coat
- 5: Sandal
- 6: Shirt
- 7: Sneaker
- 8: Bag
- 9: Ankle boot

The dataset was obtained from Zalando Research and preprocessed by converting the images to grayscale and normalizing the pixel values to the range [0, 1].

## 3. Model Architecture

The neural network model used for this project consists of convolutional and dense layers. The architecture is as follows:

- Convolutional layer 1: 32 filters, kernel size (3, 3), ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layer 1: Pool size (2, 2)
- Convolutional layer 2: 64 filters, kernel size (3, 3), ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layer 2: Pool size (2, 2)
- Convolutional layer 3: 64 filters, kernel size (3, 3), ReLU activation
- Flatten layer
- Dense layer: 256 units, ReLU activation
- Dropout layer: Dropout rate of 0.5
- Output layer: 10 units, softmax activation

## 4. Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters were tuned during the project:

- Learning rate: 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5
- Batch size: 32, 64, 128
- Dropout rate: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5

The best hyperparameters selected through hyperparameter tuning were:
- Learning rate: 1e-3
- Batch size: 64
- Dropout rate: 0.5

## 5. Training Process
The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01. The training process consisted of 10 epochs with a batch size of 32. Early stopping was applied to prevent overfitting, with a patience of 3 epochs.

## 6. Evaluation Results
The trained model achieved an accuracy of 0.90 on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in classifying clothing images. The loss on the test dataset was 0.30.

## 7. Model Deployment
The trained model will be deployed as a standalone application for classifying clothing items in real-time. Deployment considerations include model size, latency, and resource requirements.

## 8. Future Work
Potential areas for future work include experimenting with different model architectures, fine-tuning hyperparameters further, and collecting additional labeled data to improve model performance.

## 9. Conclusion
In conclusion, the developed neural network model demonstrates strong performance in classifying clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. By leveraging convolutional neural networks and hyperparameter tuning, we achieved a high accuracy rate, paving the way for practical applications in the fashion industry and beyond.
